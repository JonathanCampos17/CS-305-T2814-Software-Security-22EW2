1.Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that develops financial plans for their users. They wanted us to develop a web application and ensure we secure their users data using modern libaries and ciphers.

2.What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?


3.What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
 
Being able to use the depency check report opened my eyes on the amount of dependencys that may be Vulnerable when developing a project. 

4.How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
In the future I would use vulnerability scanners and penetration testing. I would also review NIST to ensure the team priotized vulnerablities based on impact.

5.How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I did a second depency check to ensure they were implemented correctly on the code. I also launched the spring application to ensure it ran properly. 

6.What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I always refer to StackOverFlow to compare and contrast my code with others. I would also review sites to ensure I understood the concept of the cipher I was attempting to implement. When my code did not run I also checked the Java Docs to ensure my syntax was correct.
